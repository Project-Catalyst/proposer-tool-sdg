# Proposal Framework Tool - AIM
[IdeaScale Fund 6 Proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369300-48088)

### Problem statement
Creating robust Catalyst proposals should be easier. +75% proposals don't win Catalyst funds costing assessors + proposers time + resources.

### Describe your solution to the problem
Provide a tool that guides proposers through the process with access to numerous frameworks that assist with structure.

### Relevant experience
AIM members are the team behind the voter-tool, CA-tool, vCA-Tool. Educators, developers, designers and data experts.

### Detailed plan
__Why is it important?__
Time is scarce and people are generally short of time and resources. SMART ideas and solutions are needed to solve global and local problems. Help for entrepreneurial Catalyst proposers and voters is needed.  

Goals for a better world for all have been collaboratively set from efforts across Governments, multi-lateral organisations, NGOs and civil society and have been organised into frameworks of understanding to help guide priority actions.

Funds are scarce and global finance flows must be unlocked and redirected to help entrepreneurs and change agents solve global and local problems by implementing solutions at scale for maximum impact. A lack of experience and knowledge should not be an insurmountable obstacle to solving wicked problems.

Existing Catalyst funded projects tend to lack explicitly clear, measurable targets that connect with goals and frameworks seeking to solve wicked problems that may be external to Catalyst or the Cardano ecosystem, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The competition and pressure to secure scarce funds is increasing, and has led to a systemic absence within proposals in allocating a portion of secured funds dedicated to monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for instance, and integrating measurable targets and goals derived from existing international, multilateral frameworks and target priority action areas.

__How to greater ensure that sustainable impact and a positive return on investment and intention is made?__
To plan, propose and deliver a project that has measurable impact and accelerates progress in delivering solutions to problems, you need to understand your impacts.

The proposal framework tool CARE © (Catalysing Ambitious Rising Entrepreneurs) will help you to structure your Catalyst Proposal and business plan by connecting users to a world of frameworks at their fingertips.

CARE © aims to be a tool that will not only help people develop ideas and proposals for Project Catalyst but also develop documentation for proposals on the global stage. As entrepreneurs planning projects using standards and frameworks from a global menu of options, CARE © enables and empowers users to maximise their reach of impact and chances of securing the funds to do so.

With a few clicks CARE © facilitates the integration of chosen frameworks, monitoring and evaluation principles and project design practices into your proposal project plan and documentation.

Whether at the outset of a project's inception or during existing projects, users will be able to integrate the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of a project's impacts. This will allow users of CARE © to better measure and understand their impacts.

By integrating M&E and connecting projects to KPIs, metrics and indicators from a global menu across the social, economic and environmental spheres of our interconnected world, Project Catalyst Proposals will be better equipped to target funds not just within Catalyst, but also be steps closer to the world of global finance and capital, venture capital and seed funding rounds etc.

Project Catalyst projects will be facilitated in their journey of internal auditing processes, and better prepared for external auditing, contributing to elevating the standards of proposals proposed, project implementation and tracking in the Cardano ecosystem.

Understanding a project's impacts in relation to goals external to Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem will greatly enhance the potential scale of impact for each proposal, and open the door to a world of opportunities for collaboration and synergy.

With CARE © your project team can seamlessly create a bespoke proposal that integrates the relevant framework components of your choice, helping to structure and connect your ideas and proposed solution to known existing challenges and problems and those yet to be realised.

The problems of today and tomorrow running across social, economic and environmental spheres require change agents to have access to impactful frameworks of understanding, in a simple, intuitive and accessible tool.

CARE © seeks to be one such solution to help equip change agents with the tools to help build and contribute to an impact driven movement of disruptive innovation, measured and communicated for all to benefit in an open-access and transparent fashion.
